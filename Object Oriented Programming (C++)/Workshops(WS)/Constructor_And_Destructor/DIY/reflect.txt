In this workshop, I learned the concept of the constructors and destructors and how to overload them. I also got an idea of what logic or code this constructor or destructor contains. For example, the default constructor should contain the logic to set An object to a safe empty state, while the constructor with arguments should set an object to the parameters passed. On the other hand, the destructor would probably release all the dynamically allocated memory As this constructor and destructor are called automatically, this makes my project a bit automated. Here, I also learned which function to declare a member function and which as a helper. For example, I wrote a printReportHeader() function which prints the header of the report. So I defined it as a helper as it is independent of any member variable and I donâ€™t find it reasonable to make it a ma ember function. At one point I face many errors and my application is continuously crashing. In the sort() function, I wrote a sorting algorithm that sort the array of the CleanerBot class objects. So here, I need a temporary object to assist in the process of sorting, so here as destructor is called which an object is about to die, so in destructor, I wrote the logic for deallocating the m_location. But what happening is that all last the tmp would contain the information of the lastly swapped object, so it just deallocates the memory for an object and when I try to print this member variable which is deallocated by the destructor of the temp, then it crashes my application, but debugging helped me and then I just the temp to empty state before it goes out of memory.
