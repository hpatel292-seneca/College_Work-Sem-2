In this workshop, I learned many different things. To begin with, I understand how encapsulation and object-oriented programming work. Then, I also learned how to break down a problem into smaller parts and define a separate module for those parts and how to merge them to get the final result. for example, in this workshop, I created Bar and Barchart modules. Moreover, I do write a query function that returns the state of that object and how to safeguard a query by passing a const. Furthermore, if I overload the Set function, no argument will set the object to a safe empty state, and then another one will set the member variables with the argument passed. I also learned to format the output. Here i used different functions of ostream like sef(), width(), fill(), and precision() to format my output. Finally, I learned a few new techniques to debug my code like putting cout and trying to look at what Is going on inside and also using the visual code debugger.
