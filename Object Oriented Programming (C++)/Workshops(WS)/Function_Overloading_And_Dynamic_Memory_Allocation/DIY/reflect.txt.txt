In Workshop-2 I learned many new concepts of C++. To begin with, I learned the concept of the overloading function. In part-1, I overload the read function three times and the load function two times.
   bool read(char* name);
   bool read(int& stud_number);
   bool read(char& grade);
I learned how to overload a function by creating a unique function signature. secondly, I learned the dynamic memory allocation and how to manage it, like deallocation. I allocate dynamic memory in both parts and understand it working. Next, pass by reference, I made functions which pass argument in form of reference so my function would able to make changes in that parameter, its like pass by address, but we don't need to go into writing the 'address of' operator. 
    i.e. bool readDate(Date& date);
Finally, Although I didn't use the default argument for a function in my code, I learned it. passing a default argument is something that if an argument didn't pass, the compiler would consider that default argument value as the argument and provide an output based on that. The main thing I learned is that not closing a file is a kind of memory leak. It happen the same when I try to submit workshop-1 it was showing me that there is a memory leak and thatâ€™s why I was not able to submit my workshop-1 and the same thing happen when I try to submit part-2. Now I understand to always close an opened file.
