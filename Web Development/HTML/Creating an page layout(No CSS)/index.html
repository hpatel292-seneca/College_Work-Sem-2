              <strong>House Finch:</strong>  This medium-sized finch has brown-streaked back and wings, and brown-streaked white underparts. The head, throat and rump are typically pink-red; yellow to orange variants may occur. The tail is long and weakly notched.

                    Adults have a long, square-tipped brown tail and a dull brown or dull-brown color on their backs, striations of deep gray on their wings.The breast, belly, and flanks can be streaked.Most adult males have reddish heads, necks and shoulders. This color may extend to the belly and down the back, between the wings.

                    In 1985, New York, the same state where she was banded in 1973, a female House Finch was recaptured and rereleased after being at least 11 years, 7 months old.<sup><a href="#ref2">[2]</a></sup>

                    Birds in this group are mostly permanent residents throughout their range, with some migrating south. Urban and suburban regions in North America as well as other semi-open spaces in the west, from southern Canada to the Mexican state of Oaxaca, are where they breed; the population in central Chiapas may be descended from cagebirds that escaped. Egg-laying began much sooner in warmer springs, according to analyses of House Finch nest records from California that span more than a century.

                    They were first introduced to eastern North America in the 1940s after previously only existing in Mexico and the southwest of the United States. As a marketing ploy, the birds were sold illegally as "Hollywood Finches" in New York City. Vendors and owners released the birds to avoid legal action under the 1918 Migratory Bird Treaty Act. Since then, they have assimilated; in parts of the eastern United States that are primarily unforested, they have supplanted both the native purple finch and even the non-native house sparrow. They were brought to Hawaii in 1870 or earlier, and are now common on all of its major islands.

                    House Finches feed their nestlings exclusively plant foods, a fairly rare occurrence in the bird world. Many birds that are vegetarians as adults still find animal foods to keep their fast-growing young supplied with protein.<sup><a href="#ref2">[2]</a></sup>
                    A <dfn>Voracious consumers</dfn> is someone who consume the thing in great quantity. They primarily eat grains, seeds and berries, being <em>voracious</em> consumers of weed seeds such as nettle and dandelion. They attend bird feeders all year long, especially if they are supplied with sunflower or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guizotia_abyssinica">nyjer</a> seed, and they will gather at hanging <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guizotia_abyssinica">nyjer</a> sock feeders. The house finch is known to harm orchard fruit and eat grain that has been farmed professionally, but it is typically viewed as an annoyance rather than a serious pest.

Nests may be used again for a different brood or in later years. The female constructs the nest, occasionally taking as little as two days. It is well constructed from twigs and trash and is typically between 1.8 and 2.7 metres (5 ft 11 inches and 8 ft 10 inches) high.</p>
                <p>
                    From February through August, the female lays two or more clutches of eggs every year, averaging four or five eggs per clutch. One egg is typically laid per day, and this occurs in the morning. The eggs have a smooth, slightly glossy surface and a pale bluish green exterior with a few black dots. The mother finch may lay eggs containing females first in response to a mite infestation since male chicks are more susceptible to mite damage than females are. This reduces the amount of time male chicks are exposed to mites. The possibility that representative numbers of both sexes will survive is increased by this tactic. The female spends 12 to 14 days incubating the eggs.

                    She takes the empty eggshells out of the nest soon after the eggs hatch. The pink hatchlings have closed eyes and fluffy down tufts on their heads. The male frequently assists the female in feeding the young. After being silent for the first seven to eight days, the young begin to peep while being fed. Fecal sacs are first carried out of the nest by the mother, but as the young get bigger, she stops doing so, causing droppings to gather near the edge of the nest. The young frequently climb onto nearby plants before taking flight, and they typically fledge between 11 and 19 days after hatching. One of the most popular seeds fed to the young is dandelion seed.
